        <h3>The Goal</h3>

<p>This simple project came to be due to the nature of a free screen capturing program named: <a href="https://github.com/mosamosa/SCFH-DSF">SCFH DSF</a> (it's a GitHub project now!).  I wanted to stream a game called Warcraft III, and SCFH DSF wanted me to do it in windowed mode.  Unfortunately, the game does not support full-screen window mode, and because Windows Live Media Encoder 3.2 appears to want very specific input sizes (well, I should blame the encoder here I suppose :P) ... I had a problem!</p>

<p>Thus: WindowFixer, the simple solution.</p>

<h3>Batch Operations</h3>

<p>Streaming with FME and SCFH DSF is pretty tedious.  There are a number of well written batch files around to help automate the process.  The idea I had with WindowFixer was that I should be able to simply add a single line into my batch file to have my window be routinely placed in the center of my screen at the specified resolution.  The line looks like this (well, why not comments too):</p>

<pre><code>:: Proper format for WindowFixer is:
::  WindowFixer.exe "Window Title" width height

WindowFixer.exe "Warcraft III" 1600 900
</code></pre>

<p>And voila!  It works just fine, was a quick application to write, and now I'm putting this here in case someone along the lines decides they too, could use a simple window fixer in their streaming process.
